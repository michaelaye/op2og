This shall be a collection of Applescripts from Omniplan to Omnigraffle. This might become a short-sighted naming scheme, but as I intend to use OP as the main data container, I only would add more extractions from OP, and not any scripting the other way around. The fast outlining in OP also is simple enough to *not* use any other application for outlining.

draw_swimlanes_from_OP
______________________

Selected tasks in OP will be read by the script, and this data used to create a swimlane diagram, where each swimlane represents one resource name of the selected tasks in OP. So make sure that you have assigned the resource names you would like to see as title of the swimlanes.

One advanced feature request I can imagine to immediately come up is to find a way to decide between multiple assigned resource names for the swimlane title.

This script has been derived from oo2swimlanes.scpt by the Google user bsnavin. That script
went from OmniOutliner to Omnigraffle swimlanes, but I needed it from OmniPlan.
